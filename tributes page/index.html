          <h2> Father of Indian Constitution</h2>
          <p>
            <b>Bhimrao Ramji Ambedkar (14 April 1891 – 6 December 1956) was an Indian jurist, economist, 
              social reformer and political leader who headed the committee drafting 
              the Constitution of India from the Constituent Assembly debates, 
              served as Law and Justice minister in the first cabinet of Jawaharlal Nehru, 
              and inspired the Dalit Buddhist movement after renouncing Hinduism.

              After graduating from Elphinstone College, University of Bombay, Ambedkar studied economics 
              at Columbia University and the London School of Economics, receiving doctorates 
              in 1927 and 1923, respectively, and was among a handful of Indian students to have done so 
              at either institution in the 1920s.[13] He also trained in the law at Gray's Inn, London. 
              In his early career, he was an economist, professor, and lawyer. His later life was marked 
              by his political activities; he became involved in campaigning and negotiations for partition, publishing
               journals, advocating political rights and social freedom for Dalits, and contributing to the establishment 
               of the state of India. In 1956, he converted to Buddhism, initiating mass conversions of Dalits.

          <p>In 1990, the Bharat Ratna, India's highest civilian award, was posthumously conferred on Ambedkar. The salutation Jai Bhim (lit. "Hail Bhim") 
            used by followers honours him. He is also referred to by the nickname Babasaheb (BAH-bə SAH-hayb), meaning "Respected Father"</p>

          <h1 id="india" >Constitution of India</h1>
          <br>
          <p>
            The Constitution of India (IAST: Bhāratīya Saṃvidhāna) is the supreme law of 
            India.[3][4] The document lays down the framework that demarcates fundamental 
            political code, structure, procedures, powers, and duties of government institutions and sets out fundamental rights, 
            directive principles, and the duties of citizens. It is the longest written national constitution in the world.
